Change the PORT value.

2. Client's environment file at:
```plaintext:c%3A%5CUsers%5Cviswa%5Ctask%5Cclient%5C.env%60%60%60
Change both the PORT and REACT_APP_API_URL values.

Would you like me to show you the specific changes needed for these files?

Also, it seems your .env file content got mixed with the netstat output. Let's fix that formatting issue as well.
